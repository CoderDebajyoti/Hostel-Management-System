            <h2>Traditional Hostel Management Problems</h2>
            <p>Conventional hostel management often grapples with inefficiencies stemming from outdated processes. These include delayed communication, inconsistent record-keeping, and challenges in coordinating between students, staff, and administrators. Such issues frequently lead to dissatisfaction, increased operational costs, and suboptimal living conditions for residents.</p>

            <h2>Manual Record Issues</h2>
            <p>The reliance on manual record-keeping introduces significant vulnerabilities. Paper-based systems are prone to errors, loss of data, and difficulties in retrieval. This not only hampers quick decision-making but also complicates audits, financial tracking, and compliance with institutional standards. Manual processes often result in duplicated efforts and time-consuming administrative tasks.</p>
